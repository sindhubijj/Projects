**_The Lion King_: _Hakuna Matata_ Animation:** This is an animation inspired by the movie "The Lion King" and the song "Hakuna Matata". Using Scratch, I added the Sprites to represent the characters, Simba, Nala, Timon, & Pumba. They move across the log to song "Hakuna Matata" and it loops until the song ends. This is a small animation as an introduction into game development.
